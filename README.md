# Legally Distinct Pocket Monster Arena

A game that allows users to capture monsters and have them fight other monsters.

Normal users would be able to choose a starter monster, view their own monsters, battle other monsters, and capture monsters that they defeat in battle.
Admin users would be able to create and edit monsters. They also have all the abilities of a normal user.
